        <br><h1>Creating a Worth While Dungeons and Dragons Character</h1><br>
    </div>
    <section class="grid-container">
        <div id="text1" class="text">
            <h2><strong>FIRST</strong> you must have a <strong>CONCEPT</strong> for your character.</h2>
            <p>One of the best ways to start a character is to create them based off an idea or a concept. Basing a DND character off of an idea can make gameplay easier, especially for new characters. This allows for a player to have an initial idea of how they want their character to react in situations. <br>
            A character from a Book, Movie, Game, or a TV show is one of the best places to begin. This allows the Player to have knowledge of how their character may react, and what weapons or tactics they might use throughout the game.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="text2" class="text">
            <h2><strong>SECOND</strong> you must have a <strong>CLASS</strong> for your character.</h2>
            <p>This and the third point may be traded in position. Picking a class is important because this determines what kind of combat or abilities a character will prefer to use. For Example, a Wizard will typically prefer magic and intelligence to brute strength, and a Barbarian may be the Exact opposite (However there are always exceptions). <br>
            Classes are typically where the player mostly decides on their Combat style. Based on the Idea the character is based around, Typically a player will be able to find a class that suits them the most out of their options.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="text3" class="text">
            <h2><strong>THIRD</strong> you must have a <strong>RACE</strong> for your character.</h2>
            <p>The race of a character can be important because it can give you stat increases as well as certain Racial abilities. These abilities range anywhere from being able to cast spells at will, to being able to have a weaponized breath attack.<br>
            These abilities can synergize very well, or they could add a bit of spice or twist to a character that nobody is expecting. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="text4" class="text">
            <h2><strong>FOURTH</strong> you must have a <strong>PERSONALITY</strong> for your character.</h2>
            <p>Personality is the final, yet maybe the most important part of the character creation process. While you may have based the DND character off of a certain figure from a different source, altering their personality a little to fit your playstyle can add a bit of spice to a session and campaign. <br>
            Being able to map a personality closer to your own can have its benefits, but also its drawbacks. By doing so you will be able to have a closer knowledge of how they may act, but it will also possibly make it difficult to separate the characters actions from your own.</p>

        <div id="example1"><img class="example" src="/DiceRoller/images/create.jpg" alt="Create">
            <p>An example for creating a character. First, lets say I want to create someone who embodies the idea of <strong>CRAZY</strong>. I want them to do the last thing anyone expects and sometimes shudder at the characters choices. The essence of Chaos. There is my <strong>CONCEPT.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div id="example2"><img class="example" src="/DiceRoller/images/dice.jpg" alt="Dice">
            <p>Next, <strong>CLASS</strong> and <strong>RACE</strong>. What kind of race is good for a crazy person? I almost immediately think goblin. Now what is the craziest way a goblin would fight? How about Sorcery? Wielding psychic magic at every turn? Not caring fully for his safety or the safety of his party? <strong>PERFECT.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div id="example3"><img class="example" src="/DiceRoller/images/trunktor.png" alt="Goblin">
            <p>Now finally, do I want any distinct <strong>PERSONALITY</strong> traits? Or maybe an overall mission that he wants to accomplish? How about that he wants to take revenge against the person who killed his mother, but he doesn't know who it is, only that they are a Red Dragonborn? This creates mystery and yet can give reason to your crazy actions!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="example4">
            <p>Now there we go. We have a brand new character. The only thing left is the name of the Character. This can be as silly or as serious as anyone wants. For an insane goblin, what about something like Trunktor? You can almost hear the Goblin saying his name and introducing himself. From this point, keep thinking of twists or personality traits that can increase your characters depth. Find ways to make suprises for your party members, make secrets with the DM and plan fun unexpected opportunities for your party members when that red dragonborn appears! Its all up to your own creativity. </p>
